## About the Project

Billions of birds migrate each year in journeys that are largely hidden from human observation, yet critical to the success of bird populations. To understand and monitor these populations, data and methods are needed that can capture bird movements at population scales. The eBird citizen science project receives millions of observations every month and produces detailed abundance maps for over 300 migratory bird species for each week of the year. Despite this rich information about bird distributions, there is a major knowledge gap about bird movements: for most species, scientists lack widespread, detailed data about the migratory routes that link bird populations throughout the year. In this project, a team of computer scientists and ornithologists will conduct novel research to create models and algorithms to infer population movements of migratory birds from citizen science data. Fitted models will allow inferences currently unavailable to ecologists at the scale of full populations and flywaysâ€”including simulated migration routes and movement forecasts. The resulting data will have potential to address urgent needs in ecology, conservation, and industry, including understanding connectivity between populations and links between migration and evolution, as well as applications to disease spread and aviation safety. Visualizations and educational material will be created to inspire the public and raise awareness about biodiversity and ecosystem health.

The BirdFlow project will develop models and algorithms to infer models of bird movements from citizen science data. Data products from the eBird Status and Trends project will provide information about the weekly distributions of birds in the population, and optimization problems will be formulated to infer population movements that are consistent with the weekly distributions and approximately minimize energetic costs. Bird tracking data and other evidence will be used to validate and improve models. Technically, the work will build on an emerging line of research in the area of private data analysis that uses graphical models to learn about probability distributions from noisy observations of marginal distributions. Software and data products will be created that will allow scientists to use pre-fitted BirdFlow models to simulate synthetic migration routes and create movement forecasts for species of interest. The project team will use BirdFlow to conduct ecological research about patterns and drivers of migration in the Western Hemisphere.
